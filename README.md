One Voice is passionate about bringing stability to the Defi space. Our goal at One Voice is to help you recoup your losses, emotional as well as financial.

We are crypto enthusiasts who have put our trust in crypto projects that have stolen and mishandled the investment we entrusted to them.  There is a need to bring common sense regulations to the crypto marketplace. Regulations are coming. Crypto is here to stay. Why not help form the regulations being proposed and or written that may become law? Join us to bring about the inevitable in a way that is beneficial to the Defi space. We ask you to be a part of our voice.
